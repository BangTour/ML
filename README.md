## Description
BangTour
Our application's primary goal is to provide users with suggestions for the fastest and most convenient routes to several tourist destinations. Additionally, it offers personalized recommendations for tourist attractions based on user preferences gathered through a survey. The app also presents packages for different tourist attractions, taking into account factors like the city's location, pricing, and tourism rating.

### Recomendation System
Collaborative filtering is a method used to identify items that may be of interest to a user based on the preferences of other similar users. This technique involves searching a large user group and identifying a smaller subset of individuals who share similar tastes to a specific user. By leveraging this information, collaborative filtering can effectively filter out items that the user might like.
